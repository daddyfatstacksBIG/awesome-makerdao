# Awesome-MakerDAO: Maintenance Guide

Awesome-MakerDAO is a community-curated list of MakerDAO-related content and
resources to which anyone can contribute. The long-term goal is developing a
self-maintaining document, where anyone can get paid to add or update content
and find and replace typos, with clear guidelines around how to update its
resources.

This guide details the suggested logic contributors should follow to improve
Awesome-MakerDAO.

- Follow the provided guidelines to help preserve a consistent and clean
  formatting style.
- Keep Awesome-MakerDAO relevant.
  - Add, delete, and/or relocate resources when appropriate.
  - Request approval before removing resources or when restructuring sections.

#### Bounties and Incentives

The MakerDAO Community Grants program supports members that provide useful
contributions and improve Maker's document base. Inquire about bounties and
incentives in
[#community-development](https://chat.makerdao.com/channel/community-development)
on MakerDAO's chat.

#### AMD Documents

## AMD Maintenance Standards

### General

New users should see Awesome-MakerDAO as their starting-point to learn about
Maker. Members should be able to share AMD with friends and acquaintances that
are looking for a crash course on Maker and its basics.

- Documentation should prioritize:
  - Informative and comprehensive resources.
  - A clear and organized structure.
  - Easy navigation.
  - Visual appeal.
- Find and update:
  - Deviations from the
    [Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/contributing/style-guide.md).
  - Dead or outdated links.
  - Improperly dated resources.
  - Resources to credit authors.

### Including and Discarding Resources

- Update categories with current and relevant resources.
  - Add new resources to an appropriate section.
  - When adding new content, consider the project's age, user base, and whether
    its main net has been live for at least six months.
- Discard content that is no longer relevant, repetitive, of low quality, or
  does not add value.
- Move outdated content to the [Archive](#archived-resources).
  - **Do not** move content that is still relevant to a section.
  - Only move content if it is still interesting, otherwise, discard it.
  - Some resources may already be eligible for the Archive, especially those
    over a year old.

### Style and Formatting

#### Writing Style Guide

The MakerDAO Community
[Writing Style Guide](https://github.com/makerdao/community/blob/master/contributing/style-guide.md)
summarizes the standards and best practices writers should follow when
contributing to Awesome-MakerDAO.

- Errors are sometimes overlooked. If something does not adhere to the Writing
  Style Guide, change it to match.
- Before starting work on AMD, contributors are encouraged to study the Writing
  Style Guide as well as the other community contributor guides.

#### Citing and Organizing Content

##### Citing

- Use title case when possible.
- Include the month and year of publication.
  - If a date is not listed, _inspect_ the web page, as it may reveal publishing
    information.
- Credit authors and sources when possible.
- Publication information should be in italics below the link.
- Keep the formatting style within sections consistent.
  - New citations and links should match a section's existing formatting style.

##### Organizing

- Order educational content by relevance.
  - A user's experience when reading through an educational section should
    approximate taking a course on that topic.
  - The first resource should be considered basics, and the rest of the list
    should build upon each resource.
- Order generic content by date.
- Order third-party apps and services alphabetically.
  - Maker does not pick favorites, and alphabetical lists are impartial.
- When there is no order preference, sort content alphabetically.
